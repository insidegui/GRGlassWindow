# Warning: Obsolete!

With OS X Yosemite's new look this project is now obsolete, I don't recomend using It anymore.

Check out [GRVibrantTitlebarWindow](https://github.com/insidegui/GRVibrantTitlebarWindow)!

GRGlassWindow
=============

A NSWindow subclass with a beautiful glass-like title bar.

Use the sample app and headers as a guide, more documentation coming soon.

Thank you [Raffael](https://github.com/raffael) for the challenge.
